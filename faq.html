                    "<li><span class='featureDark'>&#x25A0;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>So what is this exactly?</i></li>" +
                    "<li><span class='featureLight'>&#x25A0;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elo Stealo is a collection of new rules, restrictions, and quests that fit neatly on top of the existing rules of chess. They make games between mismatched opponents more fun and rewarding, so that the stronger player is forced to play their best instead of deciding when to cut their opponent some slack, and the weaker player has a shot to win on their own&nbsp;merit.</li><br><br>" +
                    "<li><span class='featureDark'>&#x25A0;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Why not just use time or piece&nbsp;odds?</i></li>" +
                    "<li><span class='featureLight'>&#x25A0;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can. This is mostly meant for variety, and to give new and surprising challenges to throw off the stronger player's&nbsp;game.</li><br><br>" +
                    "<li><span class='featureDark'>&#x25A0;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>What if I don't know my&nbsp;Elo?</i></li>" +
                    "<li><span class='featureLight'>&#x25A0;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You just need to have a rough idea, it's not an exact science. In fact, it's not a science at&nbsp;all.</li><br><br>" +
                    "<li><span class='featureDark'>&#x25A0;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Should I read these out loud?</i></li>" +
                    "<li><span class='featureLight'>&#x25A0;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some rules that specifically ask you to read them out&nbsp;loud. But generally, the rules are meant to be kept private. You <i>can</i> read them out to your opponent for an added challenge if you want, though some will become almost impossible to&nbsp;win.</li><br><br>" +
                    "<li><span class='featureDark'>&#x25A0;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Is this meant for OTB or online?</i></li>" +
                    "<li><span class='featureLight'>&#x25A0;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both! Though sometimes your opponent needs to know about the rule, so maybe just skip those? Also note that most online chess sites have rules against sandbagging (losing on purpose), so you might want to keep it to unrated&nbsp;games.</li><br><br>" +
                    "<li><span class='featureDark'>&#x25A0;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>What happens if I don't like the rule I&nbsp;get?</i></li>" +
                    "<li><span class='featureLight'>&#x25A0;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try again! There are no rules. Except the rules, which are&nbsp;rules.</li><br><br>" +
                    "<li><span class='featureDark'>&#x25A0;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>If a rule changes how a piece moves, can it still check and pin like&nbsp;usual?</i></li>" +
                    "<li><span class='featureLight'>&#x25A0;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes and no. If you keep it to yourself, then as far as your opponent knows it's still the same piece it always was and acts accordingly. But if you read it out loud, then the new rule dictates how the situation should play&nbsp;out.</li><br><br>" +
                    "<li><span class='featureDark'>&#x25A0;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Do I really have to resign if I can't finish my&nbsp;quest?</i></li>" +
                    "<li><span class='featureLight'>&#x25A0;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's up to you and your opponent if you want to just keep playing. But I would decide beforehand so it doesn't come to blows. That's chess boxing. Different&nbsp;sport.</li><br><br>" +
                    "<li><span class='featureDark'>&#x25A0;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>What if my rule needs me to make an illegal move?</i></li>" +
                    "<li><span class='featureLight'>&#x25A0;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't. Just follow it as best you can. Or do! Listen, we're blazing new trails, here. It's up to us to&nbsp;decide.</li><br><br>" +
                    "<li><span class='featureDark'>&#x25A0;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Some of these are too easy&nbsp;/&nbsp;hard.</i></li>" +
                    "<li><span class='featureLight'>&#x25A0;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably. Balancing for all Elos is impossible, as a 250 rule can be balanced for a 1200 vs. 950 but completely losing for a 2200 vs. 1950. If any rules are <i>really</i> off, please let me&nbsp;know.</li><br><br>" +
                    "<li><span class='featureDark'>&#x25A0;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Some of these are impossible.</i></li>" +
                    "<li><span class='featureLight'>&#x25A0;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably. I'm not the greatest chess player, so there are likely a bunch that sound fun in my head, but are more or less guaranteed losses at higher Elo ratings. I'm slowly testing them all out, but I'm just person at one Elo rating. So again, let me know if you find&nbsp;any.</li><br><br>" +
